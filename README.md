Machine learning models in R to predict loan approval

In this data set, the company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. We have the dataset with the loan applicants’ data and whether the application was approved or not. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, a problem has been given to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that we can specifically target these customers. In this project, we will build a machine learning model to predict the loan approval probability.

6. Self_Employed - a qualitative variable specifying if the applicant is self-employed.
7. ApplicantIncome– a quantitative variable shows the applicants’ income (in USD).
8. CoapplicantIncome - a quantitative variable, showing the coapplicants’ income (in USD).
9. LoanAmount- a quantitative variable, revealing the loan amount in thousands.
10. Loan_Amount_Term - a quantitative variable, indicating the term of loan in months.
11. Credit_History – a binary variable indicating if credit history meets guidelines
12. Property_Area– a qualitative variable, reflecting the area of property (Urban/ Semi Urban/ Rural)
